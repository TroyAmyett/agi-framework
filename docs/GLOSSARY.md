# Glossary

A comprehensive dictionary of terms, concepts, and acronyms used in our AGI-ready framework.

---

## A

### Agent

An autonomous entity that can reason about tasks, use tools, and coordinate with other agents to accomplish goals. Agents have capabilities, strategies, memory, and the ability to self-reflect.

**Types of Agents**:

- **BaseAgent**: Foundation class all agents extend
- **ReasoningAgent**: Specialized in multi-step problem solving
- **CodeAgent**: Specialized in software development tasks
- **MetaAgent**: Plans and delegates to other agents
- **ReflectiveAgent**: Reviews and improves outputs

**Example**:

```javascript
class ReasoningAgent extends BaseAgent {
  async execute(task, context) {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

### AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)

AI systems with human-level intelligence across a wide range of tasks, capable of learning, reasoning, and adapting to new situations without task-specific training.

**AGI-Ready**: Designed to work with current AI while seamlessly adapting as systems approach AGI capabilities.

### API (Application Programming Interface)

The interface through which our framework communicates with AI model providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.).

---

## B

### Backoff Strategy

A retry pattern that increases wait time between failed attempts to avoid overwhelming services.

**Types**:

- **Exponential**: Wait time doubles each retry (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...)
- **Linear**: Wait time increases linearly (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s...)
- **Constant**: Same wait time between retries (1s, 1s, 1s...)

### BaseAgent

The foundational class that all agents extend. Provides core functionality for planning, execution, and reflection.

---

## C

### Capability

An abstract description of what a model or agent can do, independent of implementation. Enables model-agnostic architecture.

**Core Capabilities**:

- **Reasoning**: Multi-step problem solving
- **Vision**: Image understanding and analysis
- **Tool-Use**: Ability to call functions and use tools
- **Long-Context**: Handling 100K+ token contexts
- **Structured-Output**: Generating valid JSON/typed data

**Capability Detection**:

```javascript
if (provider.hasCapability('vision')) {
  // Use image understanding
}
```

### Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

A prompting technique that encourages step-by-step reasoning, improving model performance on complex tasks.

**Example**:

```
Let's solve this step-by-step:
1. First, analyze what's being asked
2. Break down the problem
3. Solve each component
4. Synthesize the answer
```

### Completion

The response generated by an AI model given a prompt. Includes the generated text, token usage, and metadata.

### Composite Tool

A tool built by combining multiple simpler tools into a workflow.

**Example**:

```javascript
const researchTool = new CompositeTool(
  'research_and_summarize',
  [webSearchTool, summarizeTool],
  (results) => ({ searchResults: results[0], summary: results[1] })
);
```

### Context

The information provided to a model to inform its responses. Includes system prompts, conversation history, task descriptions, and relevant memories.

### Context Window

The maximum amount of text (measured in tokens) a model can process at once. Modern models support 100K-200K+ tokens.

**Context Window Management**: Strategies for fitting relevant information within token limits through summarization, compression, and selective retrieval.

---

## D

### Dynamic Tool

A tool created at runtime, often generated by AI based on task requirements, as opposed to pre-defined static tools.

### Dependency

In task decomposition, a relationship where one task must complete before another can start.

---

## E

### Embedding

A numerical vector representation of text that captures semantic meaning. Used for similarity search in memory systems.

**Example Use**: Finding relevant past conversations by comparing embedding similarity.

### Episodic Memory

Memory of specific past events or conversations, stored chronologically with temporal context. Answers "what happened when?"

**Storage**: Typically in structured database with time-based indexing.

---

## F

### Few-Shot Learning

Providing a model with a few examples to demonstrate the desired behavior or output format.

**Example**:

```
Convert these to JSON:
Input: "John, 25, Engineer"
Output: {"name": "John", "age": 25, "role": "Engineer"}

Input: "Sarah, 30, Designer"
Output: {"name": "Sarah", "age": 30, "role": "Designer"}

Now convert: "Mike, 28, Developer"
```

### Frontier Model

State-of-the-art AI models with the most advanced capabilities (e.g., Claude Opus 4, GPT-4).

---

## G

### Graceful Degradation

System design where features degrade smoothly when advanced capabilities are unavailable, falling back to simpler alternatives.

**Example**:

```javascript
if (provider.hasCapability('structured-output')) {
  return await provider.completeStructured(request);
} else {
  return await provider.complete(request).then(parseJSON);
}
```

---

## H

### Hallucination

When a model generates plausible-sounding but incorrect or fabricated information.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Verify outputs against authoritative sources
- Use structured outputs to constrain responses
- Implement reflection loops for self-correction
- Cross-reference with multiple sources

---

## I

### Inference

The process of a model generating outputs based on inputs. Each API call to a model is an inference.

---

## J

### JSON Schema

A vocabulary for defining the structure, constraints, and documentation of JSON data. Used to specify expected output formats.

**Example**:

```javascript
const schema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    tasks: { type: 'array', items: { type: 'object' } },
    estimatedTime: { type: 'number' }
  },
  required: ['tasks']
};
```

### JSDoc

Documentation comments in JavaScript that describe types, parameters, and return values.

**Example**:

```javascript
/**
 * Execute an agent with a task
 * @param {Agent} agent - The agent to execute
 * @param {Task} task - Task to perform
 * @returns {Promise<Result>} Execution result
 */
async function executeAgent(agent, task) { }
```

---

## L

### Latency

### Prompt Engineering

The practice of designing effective prompts to elicit desired behaviors from AI models.

### Prompt Template

A reusable prompt structure with variables that can be filled in for specific use cases.

**Example**:

```javascript
const template = "Summarize this text: {{text}}\nKeep it under {{maxWords}} words.";
```

### Provider

---

## R

### Rate Limiting

Controlling the frequency of API requests to avoid overwhelming services or exceeding quotas.

### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

A prompting pattern that interleaves reasoning (thinking) and acting (tool use) steps.

**Format**:

```
Thought: [reasoning]
Action: [tool to use]
Action Input: [input]
Observation: [result]
... repeat ...
Final Answer: [answer]
```

### Reasoning Agent

An agent specialized in multi-step problem solving and logical reasoning.

### Reflection

The process where an agent evaluates its own outputs and identifies improvements. Critical for self-improvement.

**Reflection Pattern**:

```javascript
async reflect(result) {
  const evaluation = await this.evaluate(result);
  const improvements = await this.suggest(evaluation);
  return improvements;
}
```

### Retry Logic

Automatically retrying failed operations with configurable backoff strategies.

---

## S

### Semantic Memory

Memory of facts, concepts, and general knowledge. Answers "what is X?"

**Storage**: Typically in vector database for similarity-based retrieval.

### Short-Term Memory

Temporary memory of the current task or conversation. Cleared after task completion.

**Storage**: Typically in-memory (JavaScript objects/Map).

### Static Tool

A pre-defined tool with fixed functionality, as opposed to dynamically generated tools.

### Streaming

Receiving model outputs incrementally as they're generated, rather than waiting for the complete response.

**Benefits**:

- Better user experience (see progress)
- Lower perceived latency
- Can process output as it arrives

### Structured Output

Model responses formatted as valid JSON or other structured data, rather than freeform text.

### Subtask

---

## T

### Task

A unit of work to be accomplished, with a description, requirements, and expected outputs.

### Task Decomposition

Breaking a complex goal into smaller, manageable subtasks with dependencies and execution order.

### Token

The basic unit of text that models process. Roughly 4 characters or ¾ of a word in English.

**Token Count**: Number of tokens in a text. Important for context limits and cost.

### Tool

**Example**:

```
Convert this text to JSON format: "John, 25, Engineer"
```

---
